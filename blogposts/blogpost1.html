        <h4 style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Hi! I know that this blog post - which I promised to post on weekend - was posted a tad later than it should have. <br>
        However, I hope you can forgive me just this once :)</h4>
        <p>In this blog post, I just want to explain what I do, and what projects I've got planned.</p>

        <h3 class="intro">What I Do</h3>
        <p style="margin-top: 0.5%;">I'm a Rust developer who enjoys creating software that people find useful, easy-to-use, and use often. This includes but isn't lmited to<br>
        <code><a href="https://github.com/dylanaraps/neofetch" target="_blank">neofetch</a></code>, <code><a href="https://github.com/fosskers/aura" target="_blank">aura</a></code>, etc.</p>

        <h3 class="intro">What I'm Working On</h3>
        <p style="margin-top: 0.5%; line-height: 15pt;">As you may have seen on my <code><a href="../index.html">homepage</a></code>, I'm working on a <code><a href="https://github.com/devraza/bitengraph">computer optmiser and analyser with everything you need</a></code>. <br>
        Hopefully, I'll write a blog post explaining it soon. <code>statsfornerds</code>, a code visualiser, has also been planned, <br> but I am currently unsure which I will work on first.</p>

        <p><b>Abdulmujeeb Raji</b>, a close friend of mine, will be helping with both projects, <code>statsfornerds</code> being his idea and him having most rights over it.</p>
        <h4 style="margin-top: 0;">You can see his projects and blog posts on his own website, <code><a href="https://imreallybored.xyz">here</a></code>.</h4>
